# How does it work?

`The app keeps track of mock assignments which are located in a cloud database in MongoDB.`

`You can add, edit and delete assignments from the database.`

`Editing assignments is only allowed when the login toggle is switched on.`

`The assignments are divided into two categories; 'Due' and 'Submitted'. Ticking the checkbox 'mark as submitted' will move the assignment into the 'Submitted' category.`
